## This project covers how to run containerized applications with Docker.

The Docker Project started in 2013 and became the de facto standard for executing programs in a portable sandbox environment called a "container." It is probably one of the reasons for the high rate of cloud adoption in the industry.

One of the predictions of the analyst firm Gartner is that by 2022, 75% of organizations will be running three or more containerized applications in production. So it is high time for organizations to jump on board. Docker changed the IT infrastructure, and everybody uses it. Big cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, or any of today's big corporations use Docker.

This practical project focuses on running containerized applications with Docker on Ubuntu. The project covers the installation of Docker Engine, understanding Docker Client, running web servers in a Docker container, accessing the shell of a container, and modifying a container.

1. [Installation of Docker Engine on Ubuntu](docs/1-installing-docker-engine-on-ubuntu.md): The project starts with the installation of the Docker Engine on Ubuntu. It covers the installation process, checking the installed version, and configuring Docker to start on boot.
2. [Understanding Docker Client](docs/2-the-docker-client.md): Next, the project explains the Docker client and its role in managing Docker containers. It covers various Docker commands, such as docker run, docker stop, docker ps, and docker logs.
3. [Lab: Running Web Servers in a Docker Container](docs/3-lab-running-webservers-in-a-docker-container.md): The project includes a lab on running web servers in a Docker container. It explains how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a Docker container. The lab covers using different web server images, such as Apache and Nginx.
4. [Getting Shell Access to a Container](docs/4-getting-shell-access-to-a-container.md): The project explains how to access shell of a running container. It covers using the Docker exec command and Docker attach command to access shell of a container.
5. [Modifying a Container](docs/5-modifying-a-container.md): The project also covers modifying a running container. It explains how to create a new image from a running container, modify the image, and create a new container from the modified image.

This practical project provides a comprehensive understanding of running containerized applications with Docker on Ubuntu. It covers the installation process, understanding the Docker client, running web servers in a Docker container, accessing the shell of a container, and modifying a container. This project is a must-do for anyone interested in Docker and containerization.
